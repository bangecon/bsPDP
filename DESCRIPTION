Description: This is a collection of functions for inference machine learning and other methods 
  using partial dependence plots.
Functions include: 
    bsPDP() to bootstrap a predictive model for the purpose of computing confidence intervals. 
    bsPDP.lm() implements bsPDP for simple least-squares linear models
    bsPDP.glm() implements bspdp for generalized linear models
    bsPDP.randomForest() implements bsPDP with the randomForest package
    bsPDP.caret() implements bsPDP with the caret package (and corresponding methods)
    bsPDP.BayesTree() and bsPDP.dbarts implements bsPDP for BART (dbarts is faster). 
    bsPDP.iptw_est() for the inverse probability of treatment weights estimator. 
    bsPDP.hi_est() for the Hirano and Imbens (2004) estimator. 
    plot_bsPDP() to plot the bootstrapped PDPs.
